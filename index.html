    <p> It was like, i was a tree with only one leaf on it, but you added many more leaves to it through teaching me so many coding concepts.</p>
    <p> A flower can only grow upto a specific point, but ma'am you are turning me into a flower which can never stop growing.</p>
    <p> Coding was sitting on one end on the river and i was sitting on the other side, figuring out ways to reach to it. You were the boat i could sail in ma'am and embrace coding.</p>
    <p> It was like i was walking on a dark path of coding without any light, but you came like a sun and made the whole path bright for me.</p>
    <p> THANK YOU A LOT MA'AM AND YOUR THE BEST CODING TEACHER ONE COULD EVER FIND</p>
